## What is Shiny?

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

* Shiny is an open source R package that provides a framework for building web applications using R.

* Shiny helps you turn your analyses into interactive web applications without requiring HTML, CSS, or JavaScript knowledge.

# Building a Shiny app {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## Packages required

Assuming that you already have R installed, you will also need the {shiny} R package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
install.packages("shiny")
library("shiny")
```

## Structure of a Shiny App

Shiny apps come in two parts:

::: {.columns}

::: {.column .fragment}

### UI

:::

::: {.column .fragment}

### Server

## Structure of a Shiny App

* Single file app (called `app.R`)

* Multiple file app (including reusable modules)

* Shiny app as an R package

## Structure of a Shiny App

Single file app:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(shiny)

# UI ----------------------------------------------------------------------

ui <- fluidPage()


# Server ------------------------------------------------------------------

server <- function(input, output) {
  
}


# Run app -----------------------------------------------------------------

shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)

```

*Other options instead of `fluidPage()` exist.

## Exercise 1

* Open up your IDE of choice.

* Make sure you have the {shiny} package installed.

* Create an `app.R` file.

* Add `ui` and `server` elements, as well as `shiny::shinyApp(ui, server)`.

* Check it works.

## Building the User Interface (UI)

Introduction to Shiny UI components: Inputs, Outputs, Layouts
Hands-on demonstration of building basic UI elements

## Handling User Inputs

Working with various input controls: text inputs, sliders, checkboxes, etc.
Capturing user input and using it within your Shiny application

## Exercise 2

Create a ui.R

## Reactive Programming with Shiny

Overview of reactive programming concepts in Shiny
Understanding reactivity: Inputs, Outputs, and Reactive Expressions

## Generating Outputs

Introduction to output elements: plots, tables, text, etc.
Rendering dynamic outputs based on user inputs and reactive expressions

## Exercise 3

Add reactive component

# Deploying a Shiny app {background-color="#D9DBDB"}

## What do we mean by deployment?

## *Traditional* deployment

Options for deploying Shiny apps: Shiny Server, shinyapps.io, etc.
Steps to deploy your Shiny app for public or private access

## Shinylive
